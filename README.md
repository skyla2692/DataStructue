## 01. Time Complexity
Calculate Big-O time complexity. Comapre and find which one is faster and suitable to use. <br>
|Time Complexity|Big-O|
|:---:|:---:|
| O(1) | all numeric time to go through the process |
| O(n) | when all time compelxity is calculated and your biggest degree of polynomial is 1 |
| O(n^2) | when all time compelxity is calculated and your biggest degree of polynomial is 2 |
| O(n^3) | when all time compelxity is calculated and your biggest degree of polynomial is 3 |
